# 🍕 Pizza & Drinks Box – Backend

Backend API developed with ASP.NET Core for managing menu, orders, users, and authentication.

## 🚀 Technologies
- ASP.NET Core (.NET 7 or 8)  
- Npgsql (PostgreSQL database provider for .NET)  
- Swagger (OpenAPI) for API documentation  
- PostgreSQL database  

## 📦 Running the Project

1. Clone the repository  
2. Restore dependencies and build the project:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

## Running the Backend

By default, the backend API runs locally on `http://localhost` with a port configured in the project (usually `7123`).  
Make sure the backend is running before starting the frontend application, so the frontend can successfully communicate with the API.
